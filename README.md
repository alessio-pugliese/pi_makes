# pi_makes

**pi_makes** is a blog where I post and document my projects. These are mainly hobbies and weekend projects, where I build stuff, like lamps or pedal stompboxes for guitar, or other electronic projects with arduino or raspberry pi.

At the moment posts will be published in Italian only.

This website is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in Rstudio.
